The first project is here. Where do I even begin? How will I know I’ve chosen a topic that I can actually use? This is what I have been waiting for, coding something that I actually have significant interest in - coffee. So why am I just staring at the screen and can’t figure out where to begin? Why are there no step-by-step instructions? You can do this. This is part of this entire process — problem solving. 

I am very much the type of person who needs step by step instructions to learn something. I was nervous about Flatiron because in college, I was never really good at the online learning environment. You really have to teach yourself. I find myself sitting down, looking at the work, sipping my coffee, picking up my phone, scrolling social media, putting the phone down to stare at the screen some more, trying to figure out where to begin, and then the vicious cycle starts all over again.

After watching a few videos with complete walk throughs, I felt better about starting my project. There are definitely a lot of parts where you have to learn completely on your own, which I am not a fan of, but I powered through. 

As I am nearing the end of the project (I think?), currently 31 days after bundling my very first gem, I am feeling a lot more comfortable putting things together and building code. Jenn Hansen’s study group sessions were EXTREMELY helpful. She did a few walk-through’s that really helped in understanding the why in how things work, which is exactly what I need to fully understand something, so thank you Jenn. 

Looking back, I have learned a great deal on problem solving and working my way through small issues to get the job completed, one small task at a time. If I could give one piece of advice to anyone reading this blog post and first starting out at Flatiron — do not get caught up in the time it takes to complete the curriculum. For me, if I wasn’t completing lessons and “checking off boxes”, I didn’t feel like I was making progress. But looking back now, making sure I was fully understanding the concepts was actually the number one priority in learning this new skill of problem solving.
